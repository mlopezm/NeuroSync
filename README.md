# NeuroSync
Matlab toolbox to explore synchronization for multivariate signals considering model dynamics and connectivity network architecture

This is the result of my Master Thesis on synchronization of elementary dynamical systems connected in a network topology, and how the 
the network and dynamics properties change the ability to synchronize.

The Matlab toolbox included is a platform to simulate an ensemble of neurons where the dynamics and connectivity of the neurons 
can be changed. The toolbox allows to study different techniques to identify synchronization (graph theory, dynamical systems 
behaviour, spectral analysis, information theory analysis,...)

It is also included a paper where it is presented a new technique to measure synchronization.
